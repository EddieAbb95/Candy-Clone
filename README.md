Candy Clone
======

An attempt to mimic the match 4 in a row game mechanic made popular by games such as Candy Crush and more. The project never
had much steam behind it as it was for learning purposes and as such fell short. The mechanic of populating the board
with tiles that drop down, and swiping them to move them is functional. Score, menus and never were implemented.

How to Use
-----
Simply open the project in Unity and load up the dev scene. Tiles can be dragged with the mouse in any direction. Animal
icons are from [Kenny](https://kenney.nl/assets).
